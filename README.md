# cloud_cost_calculator
Cost calculator associated with Informing the on/off-prem cloud discussion in Higher Education submitted to PEARC20.  Our intent was to approach this as a) an investigator with a budget and project to accomplish and b) as an admininstrator/center director with costs they need to control.  

This is an all-in model as much as we could.  Estimates, methods, etc are included as notes in the various sheets.
