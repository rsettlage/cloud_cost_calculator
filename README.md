# Cloud Cost Calculator
Cost calculator associated with Informing the on/off-prem cloud discussion in Higher Education submitted to PEARC20.  Our intent was to approach this as a) an investigator with a budget and project to accomplish and b) as an admininstrator/center director with costs they need to control.  

This is an all-in model as much as we could.  Estimates, methods, etc are included as notes in the various sheets.  Hopefully, this is viewed as a tool to assist others in informing the discussion: "Why/why not public vs private cloud?".  There are many reasons for utilizing public cloud cloud.  Cost is only one aspect of the discussion, but it is a serious topic with real implications on what science can/can not be accomplished.
